### Advent of code 2022 in kotlin/android

This is another year of puzzles, this time in kotlin

## Things to remember

 - When calculating a position of a text on screen, make sure the text is monospaced...
 - [coerceIn](https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.ranges/coerce-in.html). given a number get the closest number in a provided range (day9)
 - Kotlin does now throw an overflow when you calculate an Int over it's MAX_VALUE... (day11)
